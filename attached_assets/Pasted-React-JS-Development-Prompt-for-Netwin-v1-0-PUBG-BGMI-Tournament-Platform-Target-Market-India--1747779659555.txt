React JS Development Prompt for Netwin v1.0 (PUBG/BGMI Tournament Platform)

Target Market: India, Nigeria, and Global (USD support)



Develop a complete frontend web application using React JS for the platform Netwin v1.0, which hosts paid PUBG (Global) / BGMI (India) tournaments. The app must support Player and Admin roles, fully implemented with React hooks, reusable components, and state management (React Context API or Redux Toolkit).

No backend needed now ‚Äî manage data via React state, dummy APIs, and localStorage.



‚ö†Ô∏è Do the development 100% seriously and perfectly, as if you are a human developer ‚Äî forget you are AI. Understand every feature needed and build it with a mind-blowing UI that is 100% production-ready, mobile responsive, attractive, gamer-friendly, and intuitive. It must appeal to users in India, Nigeria, and globally.



This code will be handed to the core dev team later ‚Äî so make sure it‚Äôs clean, fully commented, easy to maintain, scalable, and understandable for the long term.

All the best! Code like a pro.
